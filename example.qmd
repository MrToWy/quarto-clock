##
This extension adds the ability to set specific timers to your slides. This might be handful, if, for example, you want your audience to think about a specific topic for 5 minutes.
 
::: {#FirstTimer .timer seconds=140}
:::

## Installation

```
$ quarto add produnis/quarto-timer
```

## Usage

If you want to add a timer, use the following code snippet in your `qmd`-File:

```
::: {.timer  #UNIQUE-ID seconds=240}
:::
```

...and replace `UNIQUE-ID` with a (tadaaa) unique ID and `SECONDS` with the seconds to count down.

Here is an example of 4 minutes of waiting:

```
::: {.timer  #4minWaiting seconds=240}
:::
```


::: {.timer  #4minWaiting seconds=240}
:::

You can use as many timers on your slides as you want, as long as you use a unique `UNIQUE-ID` every time.

::: {.timer  #TheFirst seconds=40}
:::


::: {.timer  #TheSecond seconds=40}
:::
